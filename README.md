ESP32-Powered Smart SafeBoxThis project details the construction of a secure, feature-rich SafeBox using an ESP32 microcontroller. It combines multiple layers of security, including a keypad password, a fingerprint scanner, and a web-based interface for advanced configuration. It's an excellent project for intermediate to advanced electronics hobbyists interested in IoT, security systems, and embedded programming.FeaturesDual Authentication: Access can be granted via a numeric password or a registered fingerprint.Secure Lockout: The system locks down for a configurable duration after multiple failed password attempts to prevent brute-force attacks.On-the-Fly Configuration: A keypad-driven menu allows users to change the password, add new fingerprints, and delete existing ones without reprogramming.Web-Based Management: An integrated Wi-Fi Access Point (AP) mode hosts a web page for easy configuration of the password and fingerprint slots from any web browser.Visual & Audible Feedback: An I2C LCD, LEDs (green/red), and a buzzer provide clear status updates, guidance, and alerts.Persistent Storage: The password is securely stored in the ESP32's EEPROM, ensuring it's retained even after a power loss.Robust State Machine: The code is built around a clean, non-blocking state machine, making it reliable and easy to expand.Hardware RequirementsComponentDescriptionMicrocontrollerESP32 Dev Kit C (or similar)Fingerprint SensorFPM10A / R307 Optical Fingerprint ModuleKeypad4x4 Matrix Membrane KeypadDisplay16x2 I2C LCD DisplayServo MotorSG90 or MG90S Micro ServoLEDs1x Green 5mm LED, 1x Red 5mm LEDBuzzer5V Passive or Active BuzzerResistors2x 220Î© (for LEDs)Power Supply5V DC Power Supply (e.g., USB or external adapter)Breadboard & WiresFor prototyping and connectionsSoftware & LibrariesThis project is built using the Arduino IDE.

Upload Code: Select your ESP32 board from the Tools -> Board menu, choose the correct COM port, and click the "Upload" button.How to UseNormal OperationIdle State: On startup, the LCD will display "SafeBox Ready" and "Pass or Fngr". The safe is locked.Open with Fingerprint: Place a registered finger on the sensor. If it's a match, the safe will unlock, and the LCD will show "Access Granted!".Open with Password:Press any number on the keypad to begin. The LCD will prompt "Enter & press #:".Enter your password. The input will be shown as asterisks (*).Press # to confirm.Press * at any time to cancel and return to the idle state.Locking the Safe: After the safe is opened, the LCD will show "Press # to Lock". Press the # key to re-engage the servo lock. The safe will also auto-lock after a timeout period.Configuration Menus (While Unlocked)After granting access, you can press function keys (A, B, C, D) before pressing # to lock the safe.Press C for Config Menu:The LCD will show "Config Menu: 1:Add 2:Del 3:PW".Press 1 to Add a Fingerprint. Follow the on-screen prompts to select a slot and enroll your finger.Press 2 to Delete a Fingerprint. Enter the slot number of the fingerprint you wish to remove.Press 3 to Change the Password. You will be prompted to enter the old password, then the new password twice for confirmation.Press A for AP Mode:This toggles the Wi-Fi Access Point. The LCD will display "AP Mode Active" and the ESP32's IP address (usually 192.168.4.1).Connect your phone or computer to the "SafeBox_Config" Wi-Fi network using the password defined in SafeBoxConfig.h.Open a web browser and navigate to the IP address shown on the LCD.Use the web interface to change the password or manage fingerprints.Press A again on the keypad to turn off AP mode.Code OverviewThe code is structured around a state machine managed by the SystemState enum. This ensures the main loop() is clean and logic is separated into distinct handlers.SystemState Enum: Defines the possible states:STATE_IDLE: Waiting for user interaction (fingerprint or key press).WAITING_INPUT: Actively collecting password digits from the keypad.LOCKED_OUT: Temporarily disabled after too many failed attempts.CONFIG_MENU: A blocking state for handling on-device configuration.AP_MODE: Wi-Fi Access Point is active, and the web server is running.setup(): Initializes all hardware components, loads the password from EEPROM, and verifies the fingerprint sensor connection.loop(): A simple switch statement that calls the appropriate handler function based on the currentState.State Handlers (handle...State()): Functions that contain the logic for each system state.Core Functions (grantAccess(), denyAccess()): Manage the logic for successful and failed authentication attempts.Keypad & Menus: The handleKeypadInput() function processes key presses, while the run...Menu() functions contain the logic for the configuration menus.Web Server (handle...()): Functions that serve the HTML page and process form submissions from the web interface.Fingerprint & EEPROM: Helper functions for enrolling/deleting fingerprints and saving/loading the password.Troubleshooting"Sensor Error!" on LCD: The ESP32 cannot communicate with the fingerprint sensor. Check the wiring (especially RX/TX) and ensure the sensor is powered correctly.Web Page Not Loading: Ensure your device is connected to the correct "SafeBox_Config" Wi-Fi network and that you are navigating to the correct IP address (192.168.4.1).Password Not Saving: Check the serial monitor for any EEPROM-related errors. Ensure EEPROM.begin() is called correctly.Servo Not Turning: Verify the servo has power (5V) and that the signal pin is connected correctly to the ESP32. Check the SERVO_LOCKED_ANGLE and SERVO_UNLOCKED_ANGLE values.
